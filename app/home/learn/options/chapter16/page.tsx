                    <strong>Skewness</strong> can mean different things in different contexts.<br /><br />

                    In statistics, skewness is a measure that describes the asymmetry of a distribution around its mean. <br /><br />

                    In options, we&apos;re often referring to the &quot;volatility skew&qout;, which describes the variation in implied volatility across different strike prices. The volatility skew becomes especially useful when recognizing mispriced options based on volatility.<br /><br />

                <p className="text-[#909090]">
                    Volatility skew refers to the pattern where options on the same underlying asset with the same expiration date have different implied volatilities based on their strike prices. <br /><br />

                    First and foremost, let&apos;s take a trip down memory lane to illustrate what volatility skew is in practice. <br /><br />

                    <strong>Black Monday (1987):</strong> Before the market crash in 1987, implied volatilities were relatively flat across strikes. Post-crash, traders started pricing in a higher probability of catastrophic market declines, leading to higher implied volatilities for out-of-the-money (OTM) puts. <br /><br />

                    Now, there are multiple types of skew in options: smile, skew, and reverse skew. <br /><br />
